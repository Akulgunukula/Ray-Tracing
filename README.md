Ray Tracing

Welcome to a  C++ implementation of a ray tracer, designed to help you quickly get started with rendering realistic images using ray tracing techniques.

Overview

This project is based on Peter Shirley’s guide. The purpose of this project is to walk you through building a basic ray tracer that can render images with indirect lighting, which is widely used in movie production and video games. By the end of this project, you’ll have a functioning ray tracer that can render simple scenes, including spheres and simple light interaction.

The ray tracer you’ll build is technically a path tracer, which simulates the way light bounces around a scene. This will develop a understanding for light physics and photography too.

Features 
  Outputs images in any image format
  Includes a simple camera model
  Renders spheres with shading
  Supports indirect lighting
  Customizable scene setup with different objects
